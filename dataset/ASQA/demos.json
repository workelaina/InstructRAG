This suggests that the surname Ketchum may have originated from England, but the exact connection is unclear.\n\nDocument 5 provides more information about Edward Ketcham, stating that he came to America during the Great Puritan Migration and settled in Ipswich, Massachusetts, in the 1630s. This document implies that the surname Ketchum has English roots, but does not provide a specific location in England.\n\nBased on these documents, it can be inferred that the surname Ketchum likely originated in England, but the exact location is unclear. However, Document 4 mentions that the surname may be reduced from \"Kitchenham\", which could be a clue to its origins.\n\nWithout referring to the provided information, based on general knowledge, it can be stated that the surname Ketchum is a habitational name, which is a type of surname that originated from a place or location.
